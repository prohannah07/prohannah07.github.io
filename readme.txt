--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

	+ Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
	+ Google material Icons (https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/)

	+ Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/)



5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
	+ No one



6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
	+ I downloaded Material Bootstrap, it is in my folder so it should be fine. But just saying.
		- I used MDB for animations and image overlays
	+ I didnt download Bootsrap, i linked a URL so internet is required
		- same for 
			- Google Font
			- Google Material Icons
	+ The Browser tool for checking responsiveness, I do not think it is reliable
		- My website is responsize i checked everywhere but sometimes the browser inspect element for some mobile devices will not worked until refreshed or opened for the first time
		- for example, the hamburger icon will seem like it's not there but after reloading, it reappears
	+ Accessibility Check "Potential Problems"
		-I have NO KNOWN PROBLEMS, I PASSED all validity AND accessibility checks BUT i have "potential problems" on my accecisibility checks...simply too long to screen shot so i just put a pdf
		- i checked the potential problems but for most, if not all, I have no control over (for example it tells me to put an alt then the next check it tells me to not put an alt ; it contradicts itself; it doesnt make sense)
	+validity checks are in "validity_checks" folder
